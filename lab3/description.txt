The project will be a sculpture that will take sound input via sound module,
the sculpture is expected to respond to certain levels of sound (dB).
quieter = slower => louder = faster

The motor will run at different speed steps: Full, 3/4, 1/2, or 0 (in either direction)

A push button will change the direction of the fan

A RTC will retrieve the time once when your power the system. Afterwards the clock cycle will
update the clock, incrementing it every second. (Use a timer interrupt to increment the time)

A LCD screen will display time (HH:MM:SS) , the fan's direction (CW/CC), and speed
